## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm NivMiz.

* I make game development, math, and programming videos on my youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@nivmiz0). 
* I'm a self taught programmer and have been coding for 4 years, and I use the Unity framework for my gamedev projects. 
* I've also made and released a large scale commercial indie game on Steam, called SINGULARIUM (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2624410/).
